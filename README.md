Australian GovHack 2021 entry

An entry for the question "How can we use Open Data to most benefit residents of Fremantle?"

We decided to construct a heatmap of Fremantle to show where the safest places are to walk based on streetlight and tree foliage coverage. This makes the assumption that heavily lit areas with little foliage (which could decrease street light effectiveness) are safer to walk at night.

Our map shows that streetlight and foliage coverage vary in Fremantle, and there could be paths that could be highlighted in that are safer to walk.
